The web service was written as a degree project. I used React for writing the client part of the service, Node.js for writing the server and GraphQL for processing requests.

As result an online event planning service for students has been developed,
which implements all the necessary functionality, as well as added several additional
features, namely report generation and calculation of the rating score.
